                        other use of the Site or its Content if such use or link: (a) suggests that Apexmont

                        Apexmont, third party content providers nor their respective agents make any
                        warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
                        warranties of title or implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a
                        particular purpose, with respect to the site, any content or any products or
                        services sold or distributed through the site. You expressly agree that the entire
                        risk as to the quality and performance of the site and the accuracy or completeness
                        of the content is assumed solely by you. Neither Apexmont nor any provider of
                        third-party content or their respective agents warrants that the site will be
                        uninterrupted or error-free; nor does Apexmont, any third-party content provider,
                        or their respective agents make any warranty as to the results to be obtained from
                        use of the site or the content. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive
                        California civil code section 1542 that provides: "a general release does not extend
                        to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the
                        time of executing the release, which if known by him might have materially
                        affected his settlement with the debtor." limitation of liability.
                        Under no circumstances shall Apexmont nor any third party content provider nor
                        their respective predecessors, successors, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, past or
                        present officers, directors, shareholders, investors, employees, agents,
                        representatives attorneys, licensors or information providers be liable for any
                        direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages arising out of the use
                        of or inability to use the site, even if such party has been advised of the possibility
                        of such damages. Some states of the USA do not allow exclusion of implied
                        warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the
                        above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. In such states, the liability of
                        Apexmont, third party content providers and their respective agents shall be
                        limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
