                        The long/short strategy is more than just an investment technique—it's a dynamic
                        framework for navigating complex markets. By taking long positions in assets
                        poised to rise and short positions in those likely to fall, this strategy offers a
                        balanced way to profit from market inefficiencies while managing volatility.
