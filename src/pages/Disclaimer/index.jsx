                        any offer or sale of securities or other investments. Any such offer or solicitation
                        will be made exclusively through a formal private placement memorandum,
                        subscription agreement, and related documents for a specific investment

                        qualifications required to participate. Nothing on this website constitutes

                        looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results
                        may differ significantly from those expressed or implied. These variations may
                        arise due to unforeseen risks, uncertainties, and market conditions. Consequently,
                        no assurance can be given regarding the realization of forward-looking outcomes.
